##################
To generate a series code (sequential numbering) in Excel for a column, you can use the fill handle or the SEQUENCE function. 

Select the first cell: Click on the first cell in the column where you want to start the sequence. 
Enter the formula: Type =SEQUENCE(number_of_rows,1,start_number,increment) and press Enter. 
number_of_rows: The number of rows you want to fill with the sequence. 
start_number: The starting number of the sequence (optional, defaults to 1). 
increment: The increment between each number in the sequence (optional, defaults to 1). 
Example: =SEQUENCE(10,1,1,1) will generate a sequence from 1 to 10 in 10 rows. 
Fill down: Drag the fill handle down to fill the remaining cells with the sequence.

Merging and sorting

library(dplyr)

# Read data
df1 <- read.csv("file1.csv")      #use example command for other than CSV or change accordinginly.
df2 <- read.csv("file2.csv")

# Merge on a common column (e.g., "ID")
merged_df <- merge(df1, df2, by="ID", all = FALSE)  # Use all=TRUE for full join

# Sort by common column
merged_df <- merged_df[order(merged_df$ID),]

# Save the output
write.csv(merged_df, "merged_file.csv", row.names = FALSE)

Example:
df1 <- read.delim("humann.pathway-abundance_A012.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
df2 <- read.delim("humann.pathway-abundance_A022.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
merged_df_all <- merge(df1, df2, by="ID", all = TRUE) # Use all=TRUE for full join and FALSE for common column join
merged_df_all1 <- merged_df_all[order(merged_df_all$ID),]
write.table(merged_df_all, "merged_file_all.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE)
write.table(merged_df_all1, "merged_file1.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE)

Some time will provide NA on missing value. Remove NA with 0
