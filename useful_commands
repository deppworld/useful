To generate a series code (sequential numbering) in Excel for a column, you can use the fill handle or the SEQUENCE function. 

Select the first cell: Click on the first cell in the column where you want to start the sequence. 
Enter the formula: Type =SEQUENCE(number_of_rows,1,start_number,increment) and press Enter. 
number_of_rows: The number of rows you want to fill with the sequence. 
start_number: The starting number of the sequence (optional, defaults to 1). 
increment: The increment between each number in the sequence (optional, defaults to 1). 
Example: =SEQUENCE(10,1,1,1) will generate a sequence from 1 to 10 in 10 rows. 
Fill down: Drag the fill handle down to fill the remaining cells with the sequence.
